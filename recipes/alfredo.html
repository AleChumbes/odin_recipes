    <p>Alfredo sauce is one of my favorite things to have with a big bowl of pasta!  It's a very rich and indulgent treat for dinner.  I also love that it only takes about 5-10 minutes to whip up a batch!  This recipe will yield about two cups of sauce total.  It can easily be doubled if you are feeding a crowd or want extra for later.  The bottled Alfredo just doesn't compare to this delicious homemade version!  If you love cooking from scratch, make some of this Homemade Pasta to go along with your sauce!</p>

<h2>Ingridients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Half a cup of butter</li>
    <li>One and a half cup of heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of minced garlic</li>
    <li>half a tablespoon of Itatlian seasoning</li>
    <li>half a teaspoon of salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Two cups of freshly grated parmesean cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>  

<ol>
    <li>The first step to making alfredo is to warm your butter and cream in a large saucepan over low heat. You will let it simmer (but not boil) for about 2 minutes. </li>
    <li>Next, you will whisk in your garlic and seasonings. Whisking constantly for about one minute just to let the garlic cook.</li>
